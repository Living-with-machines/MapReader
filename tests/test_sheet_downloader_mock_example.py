This file is simply to avoid git conflicts. It is NOT ready to use.

Before using it:

- [ ] replace the `test_sheet_downloader.sheet_downloader` fixture with the fixture below
- [ ] create the "sample_downloaded_files", and populate it with the relevant files
- [ ] VERY IMPORTANT: move the `tile_loading._trigger_download` function, to be a static method of the `TileDownloader` class.
