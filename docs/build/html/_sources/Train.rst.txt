Train
=====

Once you have annotated images, you can then use these to train/fine-tune a CV (xxx) classifier.

First, load in your annotations using:

.. code :: python

    from mapreader import loadAnnotations
    
    annotated_images=loadAnnotations()
    annotated_images.load("./path/to/annotations.csv", path2dir='./maps/slice_50_50')

To view the data contained in your ``.csv``, use:

.. code :: python

    annotated_images.annotations

And, to view a summary of your annotations, use: 

.. code :: python

    print(annotated_images)

To align with python indexing, you may want to shift your labels so they start at 0. This can be done using:

.. code :: python

    annotated_images.adjust_label(shiftby=-1)

You can then view a sample of your annotated images using:

.. code :: python

    annotated_images.show_image_labels(tar_label=1)

.. image:: ./show_image_labels_10.png
    :width: 400px

By default, this will show you 10 images but this can be changed by specifying ``num_sample``. 

You can also view specific images from their indices using:

.. code :: python

    annotated_images.show_image(indx=14)

.. image:: ./show_image.png
    :width: 400px

Before training your CV classifier, you first need to split your annotated images into a 'train', 'test' and 'validate' sets.
