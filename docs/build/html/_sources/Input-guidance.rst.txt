Input guidance
===============

MapReader accepts different formats of digitized maps as input:
a. jpeg or png files with associated files containing georeferencing metadata for each sheet
b. geoTIFFs containing georeferencing metadata
c. layers from tileservers
d. non-georeferenced map scans (e.g. jpegs, png, tiff with no metadata to locate the sheet on the earth)

Preparing your map corpus
-------------------------

1. How many maps?

2. Image quality and size?

3. Directory structure?


Preparing your metadata
