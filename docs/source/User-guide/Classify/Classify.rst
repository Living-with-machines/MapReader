Classify
=========

.. note:: Run these commands in a Jupyter notebook (or other IDE), ensuring you are in your `mapreader` python environment.

.. note:: You will need to update file paths to reflect your own machines directory structure.

MapReader's ``Classify`` subpackage is used to:

- Train or fine-tune a CV (computer vision) classifier.
- Use a classifier to infer/predict the labels of patches.

If you already have a fine-tuned model, you can skip to the `Infer labels using a fine-tuned model <https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Classify/Infer.html>`_ page.

If not, you should proceed to the `Train/fine-tune a classifier <https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Classify/Train.html>`_ page.
