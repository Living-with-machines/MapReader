User Guide

.. TODO: Add a bit of text explaining format of user guide.  -RW

This User Guide provides guidance to all users of MapReader on how to use the MapReader package.
We have tried to split our guide logically, into smaller sub-tasks, which may or may not be used as part of an end-to-end run of the MapReader pipeline. 

Throughout the guide, we will use OS maps as examples. 
**These are provided for illustratative purposes only.**
