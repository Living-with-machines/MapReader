Worked Examples
===============

We have provided a number of worked examples to demonstrate how to use MapReader.
These examples can be found in the `worked_examples <https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader/tree/main/worked_examples>`_ directory of the repository.

To run these, you will need to clone the MapReader repository and open the notebooks located in the `worked_examples` directory.
This can be done by running the following commands in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Living-with-machines/MapReader.git
   cd MapReader/worked_examples/
   jupyter notebook

.. note:: Make sure you set your notebook kernel to use your MapReader environment!

..
    TODO: Add a note here that says that you should look through step-by-step guidance before engaging with the worked examples to understand the workflow.
