Contribution guide
===================

Welcome! We are pleased to know that you're interested in contributing to MapReader!

MapReader is a collaborative project, now expanding its community beyond the initial group in the `Living with Machines <https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/>`_ project (The Alan Turing Institute).
We welcome all contributions but **please** follow these guidelines to make sure your contributions can be easily integrated into the project.

Code of Conduct and inclusivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are currently in the process of developing a Code of Conduct. 
In the meantime, we look to the `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ from The Turing Way as a model.

We aim to be inclusive of people from all walks of life and all research fields. 
These intentions must be reflected in the contributions that we make.

We therefore encourage intentional, inclusive actions from contributors to MapReader. 
Here are a few examples of such actions:

- Use respectful, gender-neutral and inclusive language (learn more about inclusive writing on page 22 of University of Leicester Study Skills pdf, also available as a zipped html).
- Aim to include perspectives of researchers from different research backgrounds such as science, humanities and social sciences by not limiting the scope to only scientific domains.
- Make sure that colour palettes used throughout figures are accessible to colour-blind readers and contributors.

Ways to contribute
-------------------

We welcome contributions from community members of all skill levels and so have written three different guides for different types of contributions:

- `Write a tutorial or worked example <https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contribution-guide/Worked-examples.html>`_ - For those who are familiar with using MapReader and would like to showcase an example of how to use it, but are not comfortable with using Sphinx to write documentation or writing code.
- `Add to or update the MapReader documentation <https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contribution-guide/Documentation.html>`_ - For those who are familiar with using MapReader and either already comfortable with using Sphinx to write documentation or feel able to have a go at to learning it.
- `Add to or update the MapReader code <https://mapreader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contribution-guide/Code.html>`_ - For those who are familiar with using MapReader and either already comfortable with writing code in Python or feel able to have a go at learning it.
