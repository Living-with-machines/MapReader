Managing version numbers
========================

To assign meaning to the version number, we use `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.
Technically we use the package `versioneer <https://github.com/python-versioneer/python-versioneer>`_ to increment the version number.  To update the version number, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout main
  git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "mapreader-1.2.3"
  git push --tags

All intermediate development version numbers are automatically generated by versioneer.
