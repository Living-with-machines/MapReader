How to add yourself as a contributor
====================================

We use the `all-contributors <https://allcontributors.org/>`__ bot to keep a record of contributors to the MapReader repo.
To add yourself as a contributor to MapReader, comment on your issue or PR with the following:

``@all-contributors please add @your_username_here for A, B, C``

.. note:: Remember to change this to your GitHub username!

For example, to add Katie McDonough for research, ideas and docs, you would write:

``@all-contributors please add @kmcdono2 for research, ideas, docs``
