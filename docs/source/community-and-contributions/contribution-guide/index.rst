Contribution Guide
===================

Welcome! We are pleased to know that you're interested in contributing to MapReader!

MapReader is a collaborative project, now expanding its community beyond the initial group in the `Living with Machines <https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/>`_ project (The Alan Turing Institute).
We welcome all contributions but **please** follow these guidelines to make sure your contributions can be easily integrated into the project.

- :doc:`Add to or update the MapReader documentation </community-and-contributions/contribution-guide/getting-started-with-contributions/add-or-update-documentation>` - For those who are familiar with using MapReader and either already comfortable with using Sphinx to write documentation or feel able to have a go at to learning it.
