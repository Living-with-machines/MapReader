Code of Conduct and Inclusivity
================================

We are currently in the process of developing a Code of Conduct. 
In the meantime, we look to the `Code of Conduct <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_ from The Turing Way as a model.

We aim to be inclusive of people from all walks of life and all research fields. 
These intentions must be reflected in the contributions that we make.

We therefore encourage intentional, inclusive actions from contributors to MapReader. 
Here are a few examples of such actions:

- Use respectful, gender-neutral and inclusive language.
- Aim to include perspectives of researchers from different research backgrounds such as science, humanities and social sciences by not limiting the scope to only scientific domains.
- Make sure that color palettes used throughout figures are accessible to color-blind readers and contributors.
